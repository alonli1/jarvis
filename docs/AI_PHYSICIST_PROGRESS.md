# AI-physicist roadmap progress

## 2026-08-29 — Phase A baseline audit complete

- Baseline: `9aa8b6063798355970ee2c47991fe3ccbb36edd8` on `ai-physicist-roadmap`.
- Evidence: [AUDIT-2026-08-29-AI-PHYSICIST-BASELINE.md](AUDIT-2026-08-29-AI-PHYSICIST-BASELINE.md).
- Validation: dependency sync, 47 passing tests, 63% coverage, diagnostics, retrieval, live literature query, and explicit computation workbench execution.
- Known limitation: Ruff has 14 pre-existing findings; Semantic Scholar rate-limited the live query.
- Honey isolation: unavailable in this Codex environment; no architecture or critical-review subagent was used.

## Next milestone

Phase C: add backward-compatible Manifest v2 scientific result types while preserving v1 run-bundle workflows.

## 2026-08-29 — Phase B evaluation-suite foundation complete

- Added 20 source/tool-evidence cases across retrieval, literature (including paper-reproduction prerequisites), QFT, GR, and computation.
- Added `jarvis eval run`, which produces a machine-readable report without a model call and treats case failures as report data.
- Validation: focused evaluation/CLI tests, full suite (`50 passed`), new-code Ruff check, and a real local report (`20 passed`, `0 failed`).
- Scope: this is evidence/tool availability evaluation only; it does not validate scientific answers, derivations, or claims.
