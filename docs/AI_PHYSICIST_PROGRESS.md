# AI-physicist roadmap progress

## 2026-08-29 — Phase A baseline audit complete

- Baseline: `9aa8b6063798355970ee2c47991fe3ccbb36edd8` on `ai-physicist-roadmap`.
- Evidence: [AUDIT-2026-08-29-AI-PHYSICIST-BASELINE.md](AUDIT-2026-08-29-AI-PHYSICIST-BASELINE.md).
- Validation: dependency sync, 47 passing tests, 63% coverage, diagnostics, retrieval, live literature query, and explicit computation workbench execution.
- Known limitation: Ruff has 14 pre-existing findings; Semantic Scholar rate-limited the live query.
- Honey isolation: unavailable in this Codex environment; no architecture or critical-review subagent was used.

## Next milestone

Phase B: implement a small, machine-readable scientific evaluation-suite skeleton before any model routing or orchestration behavior.
